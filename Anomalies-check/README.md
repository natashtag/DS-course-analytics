__Setting the alert messages in case anomalies in metrics are detected.__
Number of messages from Android and iOS platforms are monitored every 15 minutes (period). 
The three-sigma rule is used to set upper and lower limits for the metric. The value of metric should be within limits:<br>
  _rolling average of the last n periods Â± number of standard deviations for the last n periods._
